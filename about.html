                            Born and raised in America, I started classical violin at 4 years old. 
                            <br>My mother, who was a pianist, pushed me to become a better musician everyday.
                            <br>Throughout my school life, I participated in orchestras, recitals and contests with my violin performance.
                            <br>
                            <br>During my junior year of highschool, I discovered music production, and forced my father to buy Ableton Live.
                            <br>From then on, I self taught myself music production and fell in love with electronic music creation.
                            <br>
                            <br>Now studying at the Berklee College of Music, I am learning not only music production as an Electronic Production and Design major, but also jazz violin, and programming, which is why this website exists!
                            <br>
                            <br>This website was created from scratch with html by me!
                            <br>It is a collection of all my musical and programming work, and is like a portfolio that I have on the internet for all to see.
                            <br>
                            <br>I hope you enjoy!
